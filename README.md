## Getting Started 
`npm install`
`npm start`

## Upcoming 

1. Front-end UI and UX for an end-user blockchain-enabled individual identity and digital signature prototype application

A. Initial mockups

B. Architectural documentation, including: user flow, UI content, key use cases, data model and conceptual architecture for analytics

C. Qualitative software testing and documentation of plan and results

D. Slides and screen video of informal mid-project demo and final demo

E. UI/UX for the app will be committed to the project GitHub repo

2. Documentation:
Documentation will be included in the project GitHub repository in an agreed format such as slides or doc or the github wiki or github issues. Documentation includes:

A. Diagram: Documentation will include the diagram provided by MIT depicting key roles, interactions and workflow of the prototype applications and a brief description of how the UI and UX reflects the information contained in the diagram.

B. The demo slides and screen walkthrough video will show two key actions, namely 1. Digital signatures used to sign legal contracts and notices are publicly verifiable by use of the public key associated with a Bitcoin and/or Ethereum public blockchains address associated with the signer; and 2. Digitally signed contracts and legal notices accessible at a standard URL on the web in the form of human readable pure text files.
